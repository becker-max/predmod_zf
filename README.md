Zusammenfassung vom MSE Modul Predictive Modeling

This repository has all the shit you need for PredMod - Python Version

The Jupyter Notebook, HTML, and PDF are identical.
The summary is quite extensive.
- Therefore, for learning purposes I would suggest using the PDF, so you can navigate using chapters and skip the more detailed chapters if you don't feel like it.
- If you want to run the entire code, you can use the Jupyter Notebook. Everything should be self-contained, so cloning this repo should be enough to run everything.
- For the Exam however, I would advise you to use the HTML. It keeps the Latex formulas formatted, but it is easier and faster to search for stuff with Ctrl + F, since the Notebook takes quite some time to load (at least on my shitty laptop) and copy-pasting code from PDF is an absolute pain in the ass as you probably know.

Hope this helps, so you can ace that exam.
